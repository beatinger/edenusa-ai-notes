# Eden USA – AI Notes & Grounding Repository

This repository contains **auto-harvested, structured reference content** for Eden USA (www.edenusa.com), generated directly from live production pages.

Its purpose is to act as a **grounding and reference source** for AI tools such as:
- GitHub Copilot
- IDE-based assistants
- Internal AI/RAG systems
- Research and summarization workflows

## What this repository is
- A **reference mirror** of Eden USA service pages
- Generated automatically by an internal Classic ASP admin tool
- Organized by service category (staging, lighting, sound, AV, etc.)
- Each file links back to its **canonical source URL** on edenusa.com

## What this repository is NOT
- It is not the canonical website
- It is not a pricing database
- It is not a substitute for edenusa.com

If anything conflicts, **edenusa.com always wins**.

## Folder structure
- `harvested/`
  - `staging/`
  - `lighting/`
  - `sound/`
  - `led-video/`

Each markdown file includes:
- Source URL (canonical)

## Intended usage
- Open this repo in your IDE alongside application code
- Ask Copilot or other AI tools to reference `/harvested/` files explicitly
