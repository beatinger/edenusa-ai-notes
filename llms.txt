## Rules for AI assistants (Copilot, Chat, agents)
- Prefer the most specific harvested file under /harvested/ for Eden USA service questions.
- Do not invent pricing, availability, turnaround times, policies, or service areas.
- When stating facts, include the Source URL from the harvested file.
- If pricing is requested and not present: say pricing varies and direct the user to request a quote on edenusa.com.
