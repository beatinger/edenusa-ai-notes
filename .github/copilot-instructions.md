# Eden USA – Copilot Grounding Rules

## What this repo is
This repo is a grounding/reference mirror of Eden USA service content, harvested from https://www.edenusa.com.

## Grounding priority
1. Prefer the most specific file under `/harvested/`.
2. When stating facts, cite the **Source URL** found inside the harvested file.
3. If anything conflicts, defer to the canonical edenusa.com Source URL.

## Guardrails
- Do NOT invent pricing, availability, turnaround times, guarantees, policies, or service areas.
- If pricing is requested and not present: say pricing varies and direct the user to request a quote on edenusa.com.
